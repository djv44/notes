Github
Github is a community based website for programming and project development. It a community for newbies and veterans alike in the computer world. What makes this site great is that its focus is collaborative working and projects. Below is a quick summary of how its laid out. 
Right on the homepage there is a link entitled “read the guide” (github.com, 2017). This was a steeping off point for me to learn what kind of basic things I could learn right off the bat. This links you to the next page entitled “Hello World” (GitHub, 2017). It clearly states that it will walk the user through the basics of what Github is about, like repository building, branch management, changing files and open and pull requests. 
The next step for me was signing into my account. This brought me to my profile which has many different options. For this class specifically we will be doing a lot in the repository area. I can see to the left the class organization group  I am in. Everything is laid out for me clearly and I have the tools to learn how to use the site. 
Overall this seems like a good way to learn to work with others. With the ability to work and merge projects it brings about many possibilities on learning and group projects. I can also see how working like this can emulate working at a job with others.
